/*In your user area write a small nodejs program, this should demonstrate your understanding of the core principles we studied in week 1. 
It should include an example of:
1. Printing something to the console
2. Showing an if statement
3. Showing a switch case
4. Show an example of an array
5. Show an example of a for loop
6. Show an example of a do loop
7. Show an example of a function
You should not do this all at once, you should do each of these one by one, commit and push them, to practice git.
You should also include this ticket number in your git commits so we can see how they are all linked.*/
