// Showing an if statement
// Showing a switch case
// Show an example of an array
// Show an example of a for loop
// Show an example of a do loop
// Show an example of a function
// You should not do this all at once, you should do each of these one by one, commit and push them, to practice git.


console.log("Hello World!"); //1. Print something to the console.
