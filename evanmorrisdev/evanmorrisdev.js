// In your user area write a small nodejs program, this should demonstrate your understanding of the core principles we studied in week 1. It should include an example of:


// Showing a switch case
// Show an example of an array
// Show an example of a for loop
// Show an example of a do loop
// Show an example of a function
// You should not do this all at once, you should do each of these one by one, commit and push them, to practice git.


//1. Print something to the console.
console.log("Hello World!");

//2. Showing an if statement
var firstNumber = 3;
var secondNumber = 0.5;

    console.log(firstNumber + " x " + secondNumber + " is greater than " + firstNumber + " + " + secondNumber);
}
else {
    console.log(firstNumber + " x " + secondNumber + " is greater than " + firstNumber + " + " + secondNumber);
