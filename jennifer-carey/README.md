## Hi, I'm Jennifer!

After a career as an accidental Digital Marketer in the travel industry, I've decided to merge my knowledge of content writing and SEO with my curiosity for web development and UX.

I'm currently studying web development and software engineering on an immersive 12-week coding bootcamp with Code Nation.
