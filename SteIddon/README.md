### Hey! Thanks for viewing my profile :smile:



## About Me 
I am just starting on my journey as a developer, currently enjoying a 12 week immersive Master Coding boot camp with Code Nation.
As my career has just begun there is no projects to show you just yet but I will be adding some exciting pieces of work in the near future! 
When I am not studying or coding I spend a lot of time with my Rhodesian Ridgeback, Zola. ![20200321_150910 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77963739/105735103-3c031700-5f2b-11eb-91dd-0da2e35a6273.jpg)
My interests and passions are Neuroscience, Blockchain technology, Bio-hacking & Liverpool Football Club. Feel free to talk to me about any of these topics :smirk:
